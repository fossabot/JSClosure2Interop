# JSClosure2Interop
Javascript Closures to Java Source Code (JSInterop Format)

This is WIIP : Work In Initial Progress. Patience required...

This project uses two other projects to generate Java bindings respecting the JSInterop specs for standard Javasscript libraries:

1) https://github.com/google/jsinterop-generator : The jsinterop generator is a java program that takes closure extern files as input and generates Java classes annotated with JsInterop annotations.
2) https://github.com/google/closure-compiler : Javascript interfaces of widely-used Javascript libraries produced by the Javascript Closure Compiler (produced by Google)

JSInterop Annotations : https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fmlEYIHcyead_4R1S5wKGs1t2I7Fnp_PaNaa7XTEk0/edit#heading=h.o7amqk9edhb9
